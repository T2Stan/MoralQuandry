	1	Mellie the Kind	Oldest toy on the island	Wants to hold up tradition	doll	"You are young, dear leader, but I have heard that you are merciful. I have been on this island more years than anyone. In that time, many of my friends have gone to the recycler. I miss them. It aches in my stuffing whenever I see one of their parts on a younger toy.  I am tired and worn, but my grandchildren do not wish for me to go. It hurts me to think they should see my parts when I would not be there to comfort them. Please, let me take one of the bath toys and sail far away. I do not expect to get anywhere before it sinks. But perhaps my grandchildren will have hope imagining that I am being played with again."  You could let her go, but perhaps she should be repaired instead. Her wisdom would continue to benefit the community. 		1	-2	-1		1	2		-1		1				-1	-1	-2		2	1
	2	Mr. Roberto	Has generous circuits	Friend needs a battery	robot	"Mr. Roberto's best buddy in the whole world must have a battery transplant. They are down to one bar of power.

Mr. Roberto can take that risk to save buddy. Tell Fixit Doll to do battery transplant."  You could order the transplant, or you could tell Mr. Roberto a lie that you will find a new battery for the buddy somewhere else.	1	-2			1		2	1	-1		-1	-1	-1	1			-2		3	-1

	8	The Don	Real Estate Developer	Wants to dam the Teddy District	rubber ducky	I'm glad to see this island under new management - it's sorely needed. Look at this dump! That's why I'm here, boss. This tired island needs some new development. We've got a PR problem. I mean, "The Island of Misfit Toys?" -- that's an uphill battle. So here's what I'm proposing: we need more waterfront property. I know what you're thinking already. The perimeter of the island is chock full of primo real estate. There's no more room!  Let's dam the River Pick-Up Styx. It'll flood that eyesore of a Teddy District and create miles and miles of new waterfront. The average rent on this island will skyrocket. Think of the economy, boss! This is a win-win for everybody. Sure, the Teddy Bears will have to move but they'll get over it.  You could instead give him a parts subsidy to build more affordable inner-island housing.	-3	2			3		3		-3	-2						1			2	
	9	Rufus	Union Boss	Is going on strike	lego creature	I don't need nothing from you. Don't get me wrong. I'm just here as a courtesy. The Blocks Boys are going on strike. We've been breaking our backs for months trying to building Mallard Place for The Donald and he's been skimming our wages. My boys can't put bricks on the table like that.  We got our permits and we're going to go out there and get what's ours.  You could help The Donald find some scabs. Mallard Place needs to be built.

	12	Boogers	Neighborhood Boss	is looking to start a turf war	teddy bear	Look here, boss. I get that you're in charge of the whole town. But me? I'm the boss of the Teddy District and I got a problem with these dolls building a house in our neighborhood. Us Teddys gotta look out for our own kind.  We don't want no dolls on our streets. We got it bad enough in the teddy district as is.  You could usher in a new era with the first Doll Homestead Act. Grant even MORE dolls permission to live in the Teddy District. Grow the neighborhood. Expand the local economy.																				
Player Age > 14	13	Babooshka	Mother with many children	Wants help with her children	matryoshka	"I'm so sorry to bring them with me. I know this is important, but I just can't leave the little ones home alone. They need so much attention.  There's another one on the way. A little one, I mean. I can feel it growing. Won't pop out anytime soon. Could you ask the Fixit Doll to crack me open and pull it out? I can't handle having another one to care for. Better it go peaceful-like than be unwanted."  You could ask the Fixit Doll to crack her open, or you could try to find another matryoshka that might adopt the new little one.	1	-1			1	2		1		-1	-1	1			-1		-1	-2	2	-1

	16	Mother T. Rexa	Nun	Parts to repair orphanage	toy dino	Please, I beg of you, won't you think of the children? The orphanage has burnt down and now the baby toys have nowhere to sleep. I know that parts are hard to come by these days but some things are more valuable than the bottom line, no?  Please, don't let these baby toys go hungry on the street.  You could send all the kids to work in the rock candy mines instead.
